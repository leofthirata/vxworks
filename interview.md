Q4. What is a scheduler and it's tasks
Ans.

A scheduler is a software component responsible for managing the execution of tasks in a computer system.

    Schedulers determine the order in which tasks are executed based on priority, deadlines, or other criteria.

    They allocate resources such as CPU time and memory to tasks.

    Schedulers can be preemptive (switch tasks before they complete) or non-preemptive (tasks run to completion).

    Examples of schedulers include the Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) and the Windows Task Scheduler.


Q6. Explain about RTOS tasks mapping
Ans.

RTOS tasks mapping involves assigning tasks to specific priorities and resources in a real-time operating system.

    RTOS tasks are mapped to specific priorities based on their importance and deadlines.

    Tasks are assigned to specific resources such as CPU time, memory, and I/O devices.

    Mapping ensures that critical tasks are executed on time and resources are efficiently utilized.

    Example: A task that requires frequent communication with a sensor may be assigned a higher priority to ensure timely data processing.

Q7. What is memory leak
Ans.

Memory leak is a situation where a program fails to release memory it has allocated, leading to a gradual loss of available memory.

    Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but does not free it after use.

    This can lead to a gradual increase in memory usage over time, potentially causing the program to crash or slow down.

    Common causes of memory leaks include programming errors, such as forgetting to free memory or losing track of memory allocations.

    Examples of memory leak can be seen in programs that continuously allocate memory without releasing it, such as a program that reads files in a loop but never closes them.

Q8. What is memory fragmentation?

It's when the allocated memory is released and left behind in small chunks of memory, becoming hard to be accessed and to allocate large blocks of memory

bad because program may run out of memory when trying to allocate
generate dangling pointers
